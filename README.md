# mp-time-split

> Use Materials Project time-splits for generative modeling benchmarking.

While methods for cross-validating accuracy of materials informatics models is well
estabilished (see for example [Matbench](https://matbench.materialsproject.org/)),
evaluating the performance of generative models such as
[FTCP](https://github.com/PV-Lab/FTCP) or
[imatgen](https://github.com/kaist-amsg/imatgen), and [many
others](https://github.com/stars/sgbaird/lists/materials-generative-models) is less
straightforward. Recently, [Xie et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06197) introduced new
benchmark datasets and metrics in [CDVAE](https://github.com/txie-93/cdvae) for several
state-of-the-art algorithms. This repository acts as a supplement to CDVAE benchmarks,
delivering [a new benchmark dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Materials_Project_Time_Split_Data/19991516) (`Materials_Project_Time_Split_52` or **MPTS-52**) with time-based (5 $\times$ train/val)
+train/test splits suitable for cross-validated hyperparameter optimization and
subsequent benchmarking via the test split. **MPTS-52** is most comparable to **MP-20**
from [Xie et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06197), with the difference that up to 52
atoms are allowed and possibly a difference in the unique elements, as no elemental
filtering was applied (e.g. removal of radioactive elements).

## Quick Start
### Installation
```bash
conda env create -n mp-time-split -c conda-forge mp-time-split
conda activate mp-time-split
```

### Example
```python
from mp_time_split.core import MPTimeSplit

mpt = MPTimeSplit(target="energy_above_hull")
mpt.load(dummy=False)

for fold in mpt.folds:
    train_inputs, val_inputs, train_outputs, val_outputs = mpt.get_train_and_val_data(
        fold
    )

final_train_inputs, test_inputs, final_train_outputs, test_outputs = mpt.get_test_data()
```

### Output
```python
print(train_inputs.iloc[0], train_outputs)
```

<table>
<tr>
<th> `train_inputs.iloc[0]` </th>
<th> `train_outputs` </th>

```{note}
Data (e.g. `train_inputs`, `train_outputs`) is sorted by earliest publication year.
The Materials Project ID number is used as the pandas `Series` index. The "mp-" and
"mvc" suffixes are dropped, except that "-" is retained in case of "mvc-" to make it
negative in the index and distinguish between "mp-" and "mvc-" type entries. This is
to make it easy to sort the entries based on the index. See https://matsci.org/t/how-do-i-do-a-time-split-of-materials-project-entries-e-g-pre-2018-vs-post-2018/42584/2?u=sgbaird
for more information. More detailed information (e.g. BibTeX references) can be accessed
via `mpt.data`.
```

For additional examples, see the [notebooks](notebooks) directory.

## Installation

### Anaconda
Create an environment named (`-n`) `mp-time-split` with the Anaconda package `mp-time-split` intalled from the `conda-forge` channel (`-c`).
```bash
conda env create -n mp-time-split -c conda-forge mp-time-split
```

### PyPI
Optionally create and activate a conda environment (recommended to use an isolated environment of some kind):
```bash
conda env create -n mp-time-split python==3.9.* # 3.7.* or 3.8.* also OK
conda activate mp-time-split
```
Install the `mp-time-split` package from PyPI.
```bash
pip install mp-time-split
```

### `environment.yml`
In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. review and uncomment what you need in `environment.yml` and create an environment `mp-time-split` with the help of [conda]:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with:
   ```
   conda activate mp-time-split
   ```

### Local Installation
> **_NOTE:_**  The conda environment will have mp-time-split installed in editable mode.
> Some changes, e.g. in `setup.cfg`, might require you to run `pip install -e .` again.


Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

3. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   # You might also want to run `pre-commit autoupdate`
   ```
   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

4. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:
   ```bash
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```
   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.


Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

<!-- ## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `environment.yml` and eventually
   in `setup.cfg` if you want to ship and install your package via `pip` later on.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `environment.lock.yml` for the exact reproduction of your
   environment with:
   ```bash
   conda env export -n mp-time-split -f environment.lock.yml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yml` using:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yml --prune
   ``` -->

## Note

This project has been set up using [PyScaffold] 4.2.2 and the [dsproject extension] 0.7.post1.dev8+g43a905e.

[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/
[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/
[Jupyter]: https://jupyter.org/
[nbstripout]: https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout
[Google style]: http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings
[PyScaffold]: https://pyscaffold.org/
[dsproject extension]: https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffoldext-dsproject

To create the same starting point for this repository, as of 2022-06-01 on Windows you will need the development versions of PyScaffold and extensions, however this will not be necessary once certain bugfixes have been introduced in the next stable releases:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold.git git+https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffoldext-dsproject.git git+https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffoldext-markdown.git
```

The following `pyscaffold` command creates a starting point for this repository:
```bash
putup xtal2png --github-actions --markdown --dsproj
```
Alternatively, you can edit a file interactively and update and uncomment relevant lines, which saves some of the additional setup:
```bash
putup --interactive xtal2png
```
