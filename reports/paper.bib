  abstract = {Assessing the synthesizability of inorganic materials is a grand challenge for accelerating their discovery using computations. Synthesis of a material is a complex process that depends not only on its thermodynamic stability with respect to others, but also on factors from kinetics, to advances in synthesis techniques, to the availability of precursors. This complexity makes the development of a general theory or first-principles approach to synthesizability currently impractical. Here we show how an alternative pathway to predicting synthesizability emerges from the dynamics of the materials stability network: a scale-free network constructed by combining the convex free-energy surface of inorganic materials computed by high-throughput density functional theory and their experimental discovery timelines extracted from citations. The time-evolution of the underlying network properties allows us to use machine-learning to predict the likelihood that hypothetical, computer-generated materials will be amenable to successful experimental synthesis.},

  abstract = {The latest advances in machine learning are often in natural language processing such as with long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and Transformers, or image processing such as with generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and guided diffusion models. xtal2png encodes and decodes crystal structures via PNG images (see e.g. Figure 1) by writing and reading the necessary information for crystal reconstruction (unit cell, atomic elements, atomic coordinates) as a square matrix of numbers. This is akin to making/reading a QR code for crystal structures, where the xtal2png representation is an invertible representation. The ability to feed these images directly into image-based pipelines allows you, as a materials informatics practitioner, to get streamlined results for new state-of-the-art image-based machine learning models applied to crystal structures.},

In this paper, we introduce the Materials Project (www.materialsproject.org), a core program of the Materials Genome Initiative that uses high-throughput computing to uncover the properties of all known inorganic materials. This open dataset can be accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data mining. The Materials Project also seeks to create open-source platforms for developing robust, sophisticated materials analyses. Future efforts will enable users to perform ``rapid-prototyping'' of new materials in silico, and provide researchers with new avenues for cost-effective, data-driven materials design.},

  abstract = {Sequential learning for materials discovery is a paradigm where a computational agent solicits new data to simultaneously update a model in service of exploration (finding the largest number of materials that meet some criteria) or exploitation (finding materials with an ideal figure of merit). In real-world discovery campaigns, new data acquisition may be costly and an optimal strategy may involve using and acquiring data with different levels of fidelity, such as first-principles calculation to supplement an experiment. In this work, we introduce agents which can operate on multiple data fidelities, and benchmark their performance on an emulated discovery campaign to find materials with desired band gap values. The fidelities of data come from the results of DFT calculations as low fidelity and experimental results as high fidelity. We demonstrate performance gains of agents which incorporate multi-fidelity data in two contexts: either using a large body of low fidelity data as a prior knowledge base or acquiring low fidelity data in-tandem with experimental data. This advance provides a tool that enables materials scientists to test various acquisition and model hyperparameters to maximize the discovery rate of their own multi-fidelity sequential learning campaigns for materials discovery. This may also serve as a reference point for those who are interested in practical strategies that can be used when multiple data sources are available for active or sequential learning campaigns.},

  abstract = {Discovering new materials is a long-standing challenging task that is critical to the progress of human society. Conventional approaches such as trial-and-error experiments and computational simulations are labor-intensive or costly with their success heavily depending on experts' heuristics. Recently deep generative models have been successfully proposed for materials generation by learning implicit knowledge from known materials datasets, with performance however limited by their confinement to a special material family or failing to incorporate physical rules into the model training process. Here we propose a Physics Guided Crystal Generative Model (PGCGM) for new materials generation, which captures and exploits the pairwise atomic distance constraints among neighbor atoms and symmetric geometric constraints. By augmenting the base atom sites of materials, our model can generates new materials of 20 space groups. With atom clustering and merging on generated crystal structures, our method increases the generator's validity by 8 times compared to one of the baselines and by 143\% compared to the previous CubicGAN along with its superiority in properties distribution and diversity. We further validated our generated candidates by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, which successfully optimized/relaxed 1869 materials out of 2000, of which 39.6\% are with negative formation energy, indicating their stability.},
